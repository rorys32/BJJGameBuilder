Troubleshooting permissions (GCP IAM Policy) for Docker Deployment

Problem was Org Project vs Non-Org Project

GCP seems to have migrated this project under the ORG hierarchy in the UI now.

Current deployment address:
https://app1-193644834042.us-central1.run.app/

Current state is 
deployed
Needs CI/CD
waiting on further Node.js development, 
move forward on a multi-user backend
validate data persistence

And write test harness!..
